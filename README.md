# Logistic_Regression-Heart_disease_prediction
Implementation of Logistic regression from scratch on heart disease prediction dataset.

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

The notebook file 'logistic_regression_heart_disease.ipynb' consists of the following steps
        1. load and inspect the data
        2. Convert the categorical variables in to numeric
        3. Apply Featue scaling 
        4. Split the data in to train and test sets
        5. Train the model
        6. Test the model for accuracy


The notebook file 'logistic_regression_sklearn.ipynb' consists of all the steps above but here sklearn libraries are used to apply feature scaling, data  splitting, Training and evaluating the logistic regression model.
